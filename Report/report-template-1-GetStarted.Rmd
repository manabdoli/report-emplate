# you may choose different output type; the HTML is most straight forward

output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged

# To use WORD or PDF, replace the above output lines with one of the following.

# output: word_document
# output: pdf_document

## To use PDF or WORD, uou need to have latex engin installed. 
## A quick way to install it would be to install "tinytex" and then
## use it to install tex-live by this command: "tinytex::install_tinytex()"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# This grey area is called a code chunk, and includes R codes

# This next line turn the code off:
## This means the codes are not shown in the report
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) 

## knitr is a library which is needed for RMarkdown to work. 
## You may have to install more libraries.
## Rstudio should inform you and install required libraries automatically.

## Introduction

Clarify the purpose of the report; clarify the problem being investigated, source of the data used, and other general information.

### Data
Provide details about the data structure, including _subjects (cases)_ studied and _variables_ collected, and variable types.

### Parameters of Interest (Models)
Formulate your questions using parameters (e.g. mean or proportion). Questions can be formulated as a test of hypothesis or a confidence interval.

The rest of report up to conclusion can be repeated for each question, or each section can include the necessary steps for all questions, or a combination of both.

## Explanatory Analysis/Descriptive Analysis
Use graphs and summary numbers or tables that describe one or more variables. These descriptive analysis should help you form an opinion about the answer and determine the solution approach.


### Adding Image
One benefit of using `RMarkdown` is that we can perform all data analysis and insert the results as image or table in the document, however, it needs some `R` coding skills.

Since you can produce all the graphs and tables using `Rguroo`, all you may need is to add images to the document. The following shows different ways for adding existing images (from local files `ocGasSample.png` and `ocGasSampleDotPlot.png`) into the document:

#### Using Markdown Syntax `![]()`
The following image is inserted with a height of 200px and width of 300px, and a caption of _Histogram: 35 OC Gas Prices_:


![Histogram: 35 OC Gas Prices](ocGasSample.png){height=200px width=300px}.


> The caption is not shown.

### Using `knitr::include_graphics()`:

The characteristics of the output graph is defined in the chunk options:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Dotplot of OC Gas Price Sample", fig.align='right', fig.width=2, fig.height=1}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "ocGasSample.svg")
```


> The caption is located on the bottom-right side of the graph.


#### Using HTML `<img/>` TAG (Only works in HTML OUTPUT)

The example below sets the width of "ocGasSample.svg" image to be in the center of the window and occupy 50% of it, and adds a caption of "_Gas Price Histogram_" and an alternative text of "_A skewed left histogram_":

<img src="ocGasSample.svg" alt="A skewed left histogram" width=50%, 
align="center" caption="Gas Price Histogram"/>.


> The caption is not shown.



## Inferential Analysis
Use _confidence interval_ or _test of hypothesis_ to extended the information obtain from your (sampled) data to the population of interest.

### Diagnosis Analysis for Assumptions Validation
Check the assumptions and conditions that your inferential method uses. 
Check sample size effect and find proper sample size.

## Conclusion & Future Study

Use the results to make a conclusion about the question by answering the question, and reiterating whether the results can be applied to a larger population, as you expected.

Determine any future directions for expanding the study, or rerunning it correctly.
